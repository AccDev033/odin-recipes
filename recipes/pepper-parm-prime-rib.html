    <p>juicy prime rib crusted with bold black pepper and savory parmesan, slow-roasted for maximum flavor and tenderness.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (5 pound) bone-in prime rib of beef, fat cap trimmed</li>
            <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt (about 1 teaspoon per pound of meat)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons very soft butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>2 rounded tablespoons coarse ground black pepper, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
        </ul>
         <h3>Instruction</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Optional step: Use a sharp knife to cut down 1/8 inch through the tough membrane on top, every inch or so, to prevent the tough membrane from contracting and distorting the shape of the meat as it roasts.</li>
            <li>Salt beef all over and transfer to a rack placed over a roasting pan. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 8 to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 2 hours before roasting.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Stir butter, cheese, and black pepper together in a bowl. This mixture needs to be very soft to spread evenly over the meat.</li>
            <li>Blot any moisture on the surface of beef with a paper towel. Apply a few teaspoons of butter mixture to bottom and sides of beef, then spread remaining mixture across the top. Apply more black pepper and Parmigiano Reggiano to the top if desired.</li>
            <li>Pour beef broth and water into the bottom of the roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Roast in the upper center of the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue to roast until the internal temp in the center of the thickest part reaches 120 degrees F (49 degrees C) for medium rare. Roasting may take a total of about 1 1/2 hours, but always use an instant read thermometer or meat thermometer to determine doneness rather than using a timer, as time will vary greatly depending on the size of the roast.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, and tent loosely with foil. Let rest for 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature has risen to 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), which will give you a perfect rosy pink center.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, pour pan juices into a saucepan and keep warm over low heat until needed. Season with salt and pepper to taste before using. </li>
            <li>Slice meat off the bones, and then slice down into 6 portions. Serve on heated plates with hot “jus” alongside.</li>
         </ol>
